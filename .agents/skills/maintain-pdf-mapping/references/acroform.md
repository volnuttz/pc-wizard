# AcroForm notes

The supported official template has two pages and hundreds of mostly opaque fields
such as `Text19` and `Check Box5`. The repository copy is a development/test
fixture only and is excluded from distributions. At runtime, both CLI commands
require the user's local template through `--template`.

Recursive AcroForm fields and individual page widgets may differ, so inspect both
the catalog and page annotations.

For each `/Annots` entry, resolve `/T` directly or through `/Parent`, and record
`/FT`, `/Rect`, `/V`, `/AS`, and `/AP` `/N` keys. PDF coordinates start at the
bottom-left. Sort by descending lower Y coordinate and ascending X coordinate to
compare widgets with extracted labels from top to bottom.

Rendering uses lopdf object updates so the AcroForm is retained. Verify output by
reopening it with `read_field_values()`; also assert page count. Visual placement
still requires coordinate correlation or viewing a marked diagnostic PDF.

Existing mappings and compatibility checks live in `render_character()`,
`project_spell_rows()`, `validate_template()`, and the catalog/read-back helpers in
`crates/pdf-renderer/src/lib.rs`.
