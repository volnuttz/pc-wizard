```

## Known limitations

### Rules and character creation

- The model accepts levels 1–20, but the creation workflow and most calculations
  only implement level 1.
- Spending starting gold on custom equipment is not yet interactive; gold-route
  characters retain their unspent coins.
- Later-level class choices remain outside the current level-1 scope.

### Validation and persistence

- Character JSON intentionally supports only the current schema. Files produced by
  older releases are not migrated and may fail validation after the schema changes.

### PDF output

- Death-save and magic-item-attunement trackers remain blank because character
  creation does not record active adventuring-state values for them.
- The official character-sheet template must be downloaded separately and supplied
  with `--template`; direct download URLs may change.

### Distribution

- Native executables are unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen and macOS Gatekeeper may
  warn or block first launch.
- The first stable Rust release still requires hosted verification of the four
  configured platform jobs. Local verification covers Linux x86-64.

## Phase 1: Reliable packaging and runtime assets

Goal: make the Python package installable and usable outside the repository.

Status: complete and verified on 2026-07-13.

- [x] Keep the official character sheet out of package distributions.
- [x] Require an explicit `--template` path for `create`.
- [x] Validate the template before starting character creation or rendering.
- [x] Document the official download page and a changeable direct-download URL.
- [x] Exclude `assets/SRD_CC_v5.2.1.pdf` and `assets/character-sheet.pdf` from
  wheel and source distributions.
- [x] Define intentional sdist contents rather than relying on automatic inclusion.
- [x] Add `pc-wizard --version`.
- [x] Add package metadata: MIT license, authors, classifiers, URLs, and keywords.
- [x] Add an SRD attribution and third-party notices document.
- [x] Test wheel installation in a clean isolated environment.
- [x] Test `create` from a directory outside the repository.
- [x] Document `uv tool` install, upgrade, and uninstall instructions.

Exit criteria:

- A clean wheel installation can create and render a character with a separately
  downloaded official template.
- The wheel and sdist contain only intentional, redistributable files.

## Phase 2: Self-contained executables and releases

Goal: distribute `pc-wizard` to users who do not have Python or uv installed.

Status: complete and verified on 2026-07-13 with the published v0.1.0 release.

- [x] Add PyInstaller as a development/build dependency.
- [x] Add a deterministic PyInstaller spec file.
- [x] Build and smoke-test a Linux x86-64 one-directory bundle first.
- [x] Build and smoke-test a Linux x86-64 one-file executable that accepts the
  required external template.
- [x] Verify output paths and template validation in frozen and normal modes.
- [x] Add reusable binary smoke tests for `--help`, `--version`, and `create`.
- [x] Add GitHub Actions quality checks on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- [x] Add native executable builds for:
  - [x] Linux x86-64
  - [x] Windows x86-64
  - [x] macOS Apple Silicon
  - [x] macOS Intel
- [x] Publish versioned artifacts through GitHub Releases.
- [x] Publish SHA-256 checksums.
- [x] Document platform installation, upgrade, and removal steps.
- [x] Evaluate signing and notarization for Windows and macOS; unsigned 0.1.0
  artifacts are documented, with signing deferred pending certificates.

Exit criteria:

- A user can download one artifact for their platform, run `pc-wizard`, and create
  a PDF without installing Python, uv, or dependencies.
- Every published executable is built and smoke-tested on its target operating
  system.

## Phase 3: Complete SRD level-1 creation

Goal: implement the meaningful choices and calculations required for a complete
level-1 SRD character.

Status: complete and verified on 2026-07-13.

### Ability scores and general details

- [x] Add 27-point point-buy with live remaining-point feedback.
- [x] Prevent background increases from exceeding 20 during prompting.
- [x] Validate ability generation and increases at the model boundary.
- [x] Add optional backstory, appearance, and personality prompts.
- [x] Add explicit Small/Medium selection where the species allows it.

### Species choices

- [x] Dragonborn ancestry and damage type
- [x] Elf lineage, spellcasting ability, and Keen Senses skill
- [x] Gnome lineage and spellcasting ability
- [x] Goliath ancestry
- [x] Human additional skill and Origin feat
- [x] Tiefling legacy and spellcasting ability
- [x] Apply choice-dependent speed, senses, resistances, spells, and traits

### Feat choices

- [x] Model Origin feat benefits and required subchoices, including Human
  Versatile choices.

### Class choices

- [x] Barbarian weapon masteries
- [x] Bard instruments, cantrips, and prepared spells
- [x] Cleric Divine Order, cantrips, and prepared spells
- [x] Druid Primal Order, cantrips, and prepared spells
- [x] Fighter Fighting Style and weapon masteries
- [x] Monk artisan tool or musical instrument choice
- [x] Paladin weapon masteries and prepared spells
- [x] Ranger weapon masteries and prepared spells
- [x] Rogue Expertise, additional language, and weapon masteries
- [x] Sorcerer cantrips and prepared spells
- [x] Warlock invocation, cantrips, and prepared spells
- [x] Wizard cantrips, spellbook spells, and prepared spells

The supplied SRD grants Bard Expertise at level 2 and Ranger Expertise at levels
2 and 9, and it does not grant Monk Weapon Mastery at level 1. Those previously
listed items were corrected to match the level-1 scope.

### Equipment and combat values

- [x] Support class equipment package or starting gold.
- [x] Support background equipment package or 50 GP.
- [x] Model individual weapons, armor, shields, gear, ammunition, and coins.
- [x] Calculate AC from equipped armor, shields, and class features.
- [x] Calculate weapon attack bonuses, damage modifiers, ranges, and properties.
- [x] Calculate spellcasting modifier, save DC, and attack bonus.
- [x] Model separate class, Magic Initiate, and species spellcasting profiles,
  including slotless casting resources without inventing spell slots.
- [x] Model level-1 spell slots (prepared-spell choices are completed above).

Exit criteria:

- Every level-1 choice required by the supplied SRD is represented or explicitly
  documented as intentionally deferred.
- Derived values agree with SRD examples and focused tests.

## Phase 4: Complete character-sheet rendering

Goal: render all implemented character data accurately and visibly.

Status: complete and verified on 2026-07-13.

- [x] Map and fill saving-throw proficiency checkboxes.
- [x] Map and fill skill proficiency and Expertise indicators.
- [x] Map and fill armor-training checkboxes.
- [x] Fill weapon names, attack bonuses, damage, type, and notes.
- [x] Fill equipment and coin fields structurally.
- [x] Fill spellcasting ability, modifier, save DC, and attack bonus.
- [x] Use class spellcasting as the sheet's primary summary when present; otherwise
  fill it from Magic Initiate or species spellcasting, while listing every
  additional profile and slotless resource in its trait section.
- [x] Fill cantrips, prepared spells, and spell-slot fields.
- [x] Fill spell casting time, range, Concentration, Ritual, Required Material,
  and duration notes for every level-1 creation spell.
- [x] Fill optional backstory, appearance, and personality fields.
- [x] Fill class-specific resources where the template supports them.
- [x] Confirm long text fits or uses appropriate font sizing.
- [x] Add representative PDF read-back tests for martial and spellcasting characters.
- [x] Add visual or rendered-page regression testing.

Exit criteria:

- A generated sheet contains all implemented character information in the correct
  fields and remains readable in common PDF viewers.

## Phase 5: Model durability and user experience

Goal: make current-schema character files reliable and the wizard pleasant to use.

- [x] Validate alignment, skills, languages, and cross-field rules.
- [x] Replace unconstrained rule strings with enums or validated identifiers where
  this improves correctness.
- [x] Separate user selections from derived values explicitly.
- [x] Add save-and-resume support for incomplete creation sessions.
- [x] Add a final review screen before writing files.
- [x] Add back navigation or confirmation for destructive choice changes.
- [x] Add non-interactive creation from a complete JSON input.
- [x] Add `show` command.
- [x] Improve actionable error messages for missing or invalid templates and JSON.
- [x] Avoid overwriting existing outputs without confirmation or `--force`.
- [x] Show contextual SRD details while highlighting classes, backgrounds,
  species choices, feats, spells, weapons, and equipment.

Status: complete and verified on 2026-07-13.

Exit criteria:

- Current-schema character files validate consistently, and users can review,
  resume, and create PDFs from them.

## Phase 6: Engineering and release practices

Goal: make changes and releases repeatable, reviewable, and safe.

- [~] Continuous integration runs Ruff, Pyright, pytest, and package builds on
  Linux, Windows, and macOS; automate the existing clean-install test procedure.
- [x] Add a test-coverage report and agree on a minimum threshold (85% line
  coverage, reported and enforced in the quality workflow).
- [~] A reusable character JSON fixture supports model and binary smoke tests;
  extract broader fixtures as character coverage grows.
- [x] Add parameterized tests for every class, background, and species.
- [x] Add property-based tests for scores, modifiers, and point-buy constraints.
- [x] Add dependency update automation for uv and GitHub Actions.
- [x] Add dependency vulnerability review or audit automation with pip-audit.
- [x] Add a changelog and release checklist.
- [x] Adopt semantic versioning and tagged releases.
- [x] Add contributor and code-of-conduct documents for outside contributors.
- [x] Add issue and pull-request templates.
- [x] Add release notes describing user-visible behavior and output changes.

Exit criteria:

- Pull requests receive automated quality feedback.
- A version tag produces reviewed, reproducible release artifacts.

## Phase 7: Rust migration foundation

Goal: establish the compatibility contract, architecture, tooling, and performance
targets required to migrate the application from Python 3.13 to Rust safely.

Status: complete. The compatibility foundation, production implementation, and
local cutover gate were verified on 2026-07-16.

### Baseline and acceptance targets

- [x] Define representative scenarios for `--help`, `--version`, `show`,
  non-interactive `create`, interactive prompt transitions, template validation,
  and PDF rendering.
- [x] Benchmark the Python oracle and optimized Rust artifact locally and configure
  cold/warm native measurements on every supported release runner.
- [x] Record latency, peak working set, executable size, and zero native extraction
  overhead using reproducible fixtures and workflow artifacts.
- [x] Isolate help/version, JSON derivation/show, and complete PDF creation
  scenarios so startup and PDF/file-I/O costs are distinguishable.
- [x] Set explicit Rust acceptance targets for latency, peak memory, executable
  size, release archive size, and extraction overhead.
- [x] Preserve benchmark fixtures and scripts so Python and Rust results can be
  compared throughout the migration.

### Freeze the compatibility contract

- [x] Document and version the canonical character JSON schema, including optional
  fields, defaults, enum values, validation errors, and compatibility expectations.
- [x] Capture the CLI contract for commands, arguments, options, exit codes,
  overwrite behavior, cancellation, stdout/stderr, and user-visible errors.
- [x] Create golden fixtures for complete characters, drafts, invalid inputs,
  derived values, supported PDF field values, and rendered-page output.
- [x] Add black-box contract tests that ran unchanged against the Python oracle
  and native Rust executable before cutover.
- [x] Inventory every rule table, validation rule, derived calculation, wizard
  branch, PDF field mapping, fixture, and release platform that must be ported.

### Prove the Rust architecture

- [x] Create a Rust workspace with separate crates or modules for SRD data, domain
  models, character creation, PDF rendering, CLI presentation, and integration
  tests.
- [x] Select and document libraries for argument parsing, interactive prompts,
  Serde JSON handling, error reporting, terminal output, PDF manipulation, and
  cross-platform packaging.
- [x] Assess Rust libraries for interactive prompts, JSON/Serde schema validation,
  terminal output, AcroForm editing, checkbox appearance streams, font sizing, and
  cross-platform packaging. Treat PDF output parity as the highest technical risk.
- [x] Build a Rust proof of concept that parses and validates complete character
  JSON, calculates representative derived values, and fills text and checkbox
  fields in the supported official PDF template.
- [x] Verify proof-of-concept PDF field read-back and rendered appearance on the
  development fixture before committing to a PDF library.
- [x] Define Rust formatting, Clippy, test, coverage, dependency audit, license
  review, and minimum-supported-Rust-version policies.
- [x] Record the architecture, crate boundaries, dependency rationale,
  compatibility strategy, staged cutover plan, and rollback criteria.

Exit criteria:

- Benchmarks make the slow paths reproducible on supported platforms.
- JSON, CLI, rule, and PDF compatibility contracts are executable as shared tests.
- The Rust architecture and PDF stack are validated by a working proof of concept.

## Phase 8: Rust implementation, parity, and cutover

Goal: replace the Python application with a native Rust CLI without changing the
canonical character format, SRD behavior, supported PDF output, or release reach.

Status: production implementation and local cutover complete on 2026-07-16. The
first native stable release and its hosted-platform audit remain release operations.

### Compatibility foundation

- [x] Promote the Phase 7 prototype workspace into the production implementation
  with formatting, linting, tests, dependency auditing, license review, and
  reproducible cross-platform builds.
- [x] Preserve JSON as the canonical character record and define explicit schema
  versioning/migration behavior for files from existing releases.
- [x] Run the shared black-box compatibility suite against Python and Rust before
  cutover,
  comparing accepted inputs, derived values, output JSON, exit codes, and
  user-visible errors.

### Vertical migration slices

- [x] Port SRD data and identifiers with provenance checks against the supplied SRD
  rather than translating rules from memory or other sources.
- [x] Port validation and derived values class-by-class, keeping parity fixtures for
  every class, background, species, feat, spell, and equipment route.
- [x] Port `show` and non-interactive `create` before the interactive wizard so the
  model and renderer can be tested independently.
- [x] Port PDF template validation and rendering with field-level read-back and
  rendered-page regression coverage matching the Python suite.
- [x] Port the interactive wizard, checkpoints, resume, review, back navigation,
  contextual details, overwrite protection, and cancellation behavior.
- [x] Keep the Python implementation available as the behavioral oracle until each
  vertical slice passes parity and performance checks.

### Release and retirement

- [x] Replace production CI with Rust-native quality and release jobs on Linux
  x86-64, Windows x86-64, macOS Apple Silicon, and macOS Intel after the final
  Python-oracle parity gate.
- [ ] Publish a prerelease Rust artifact and collect real startup, PDF compatibility,
  and migration feedback before changing the default download.
- [~] Verify that the Rust release meets Phase 7 targets and passes JSON, CLI, SRD,
  PDF read-back, visual regression, and binary smoke tests on every platform.
  Local Linux verification passes; hosted runners execute this before publication.
- [ ] Cut over only in a SemVer-appropriate release with release notes, rollback
  artifacts, and clear compatibility guidance.
- [ ] Remove Python build and release infrastructure only after at least one stable
  Rust release is verified and the rollback window has closed.

Exit criteria:

- Existing current-schema character JSON files behave compatibly or receive an
  explicit migration path.
- Rust artifacts meet the agreed performance targets and reproduce all supported
  level-1 behavior and readable PDF output on every release platform.
- Users can upgrade or roll back without losing canonical character data.

## Suggested milestone order

1. [x] Require a separately downloaded template and prove a clean wheel
   installation.
2. [x] Produce and test one Linux standalone executable.
3. [x] Add cross-platform CI and release artifacts.
4. [x] Complete level-1 choices and calculations in small vertical slices.
5. [x] Expand PDF coverage alongside each completed rule slice.
6. [x] Add validation, review, and resume support for the current character schema.
7. [x] Establish performance targets, freeze compatibility contracts, and prove the
   Rust architecture and PDF stack.
8. [x] Migrate production to Rust in compatibility-tested vertical slices; retain
   the frozen rollback oracle through the first stable native release.

Prefer vertical slices after packaging. For example, complete Fighter choices,
equipment, calculations, PDF fields, and tests together rather than adding every
class prompt first and postponing calculations and rendering.

## Roadmap maintenance

When completing roadmap work:

1. Change the task marker to `[x]` only after implementation and relevant tests
   pass.
2. Update the `Last reviewed` date.
3. Add newly discovered work to the appropriate phase.
4. Record blockers with `[!]` and a short explanation.
5. Keep implementation details in issues or pull requests; keep this document at
   milestone and task level.
6. Update the current baseline when a release changes supported behavior.
7. Run the repository quality gate before committing roadmap changes that accompany
   code changes.
